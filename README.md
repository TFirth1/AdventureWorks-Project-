--Overview--

This project is a comprehensive portfolio exercise designed to showcase key data analysis skills using SQL, Power BI, and Excel. Following the structure of Ali Ahmad's Data Analyst Portfolio series, I worked through each phase of a typical data analysis workflow, from raw data cleaning to building a final interactive dashboard in Power BI.

--Project Objectives--

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Cleaned and processed raw datasets using SQL to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Data Modeling: Created structured data models, establishing relationships between tables and optimizing them for analysis.
Analysis and Visualization: Analyzed key metrics and trends, utilizing Power BI for creating an engaging, interactive dashboard to present insights.

--Tools Used--

SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
Power BI: Dashboard development, data visualization, and interactive reporting.
Excel: Additional data manipulation and initial exploration.
